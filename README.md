# StandardDeviation
Basic script to return the Standard Deviation of a data set


# Motivation
I wrote this program to save me some time in math class when we are doing Standard Deviation tables with large data sets.


# How to use?
Use an IDE to:
- Run the script.
- Enter your numbers one by one
- Once you have input the whole data set, press enter.
